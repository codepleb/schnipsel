# Author Rewrite

When I started with github, I used several email addresses on my account, while anyways being the only one committing here, so I decided to merge all those into my most recent email. If I ever change my email again, I would need this script to remove the old one from the history.

I got the base of this code from here: https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/
